# Progfun2
Code repository for "Functional Program Design in Scala" class assignments

## Week2
The objective of Bloxorz is simple; you must navigate your rectangular block to the hole at the end of the board, by rolling it, in the fewest number of moves possible. A block can be moved in 4 possible directions, left, right, up, down, using the appropriate keys on the keyboard.

## Week3
Several implementations of a purely functional data structure are given. This task is about writing properties of a Heap (Priority queue) to unveal bugs in the implementation provided in the assignment. Those properties will be checked using the ScalaCheck library for automated specification-based testing.
